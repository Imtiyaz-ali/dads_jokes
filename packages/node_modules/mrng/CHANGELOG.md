## Version 1.0.1 (Add Extra Random Ness) - [18-03-2024]
Features:
- Enhanced Randomness Methods:
  - Added additional methods for generating randomness, including bitwise operations and cryptographic randomness.
  - Increased the randomness of the `mrng` function by incorporating multiple sources of randomness.

Dependency Integration:
- Integrated external dependencies to enhance randomness functionality:
  - Added `random-js` package to utilize a high-quality random number generation library.
  - Included `crypto` module for cryptographic functionality, enhancing randomness.

Improved Randomness Combination:
- Enhanced the `mrng` function to combine randomness from multiple sources:
  - Combined randomness from bitwise operations, cryptographic functions, and `random-js` library.
  - Increased randomness quality and diversity for better unpredictability.

Dependency Management:
- Listed new dependencies (`random-js` and `crypto`) in the `package.json` file for easy installation and management.

Version Bump:
- Increased the version number to reflect the significant enhancements and additions to the package.
